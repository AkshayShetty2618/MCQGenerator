Communication for homeostasis:
•	Endocrine: Hormones travel through blood, find receptors and signal via transduction. That´s slow but also lasts long.
•	Nervous: Impulses travel via neurons along a fixed path to a specific location. That´s very quick but lasts shortly.



Mechanism of homeostasis:
•	Sensors measure value and forward it 
•	Control unit compares value to set point
•	If deviation: signals via endocrine and nervous system to effector organ



Feedback Systems
•	Negative: status is measured and worked against (cold – increase temp.). Response reduces the initial stimulus. Simple endocrine pathway.
•	Positive: value is measured and stimulus reinforced until process is completed (birth pangs build up; when newborns suckle, more milk is produced). Simple neuroendocrine pathway.


Rhythms
•	Daily (circadian): body temp during day higher than at night, melatonin opposite
•	Acclimatization: adaption to external circumstances, which temporarily changes set point (moulting, fever, anti-freeze)
•	Homeotherm: constant body tmp.
•	Poikilotherm: changing body tmp.



Heat exchange
•	Radiation: sun
•	Evaporation: sweating 
•	Conduction: take heat from external physical source, like a hot stone
•	Convection: constant income from warmth, like showering


Thermoregulation
Is controlled my the hypothalamus and perfoms the following functions
•	Blood circulation (vasoconstriction, vasodilation, countercurrent exchange (extremities cool down blood (birds, dolphins)))
•	Cooling through evaporation (horses)
•	Behaviour (ectotherm keep body parts outside/in sunlight, endotherms seek cooler/hotter places)
•	Adaptation of metabolic heat production



Bioenergetics
Minimum metabolic rate (basal = endotherm; standard = ectotherm; both measured under constant circumstances while adult animal is resting, sober and relaxed) = amount of energy for primary body processes (onderhoudsbehoefte)



Energy conservation
Torpor: less physical activity and metabolism, lowered body tmp and breathing.
When food is scarce, draught or extreme temperatures.
Can be in winter, summer or daily (small animals with a high MMR (bats)).
