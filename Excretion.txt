Osmoregulation: 
Regulation of solute and water concentration, maintenance of constant osmotic pressure. Part of homeostasis.
Osmoregulators: regulate osmotic pressure independent from environment
Osmoconformers: regulate osmotic pressure according to environment (jellyfish, mussels. Some can work better with changing salt concentrations around them)



Salt glands
•	Excrete hypertonic substances with help of NaCl (costs ATP)
•	Located in skull of some reptiles and most water birds



Nitrogenous waste
Are broken down to glucose and ammonia. 
Excretion of 
•	Ammonium: most aquatic animals and bony fishes. Highly poisonous, excretion (both active and passive) via kidneys and gills requires lots of water
•	Urea: Mammals, shark, some bony fishes, most amphibians. Less toxic than ammonium thus less water required for excretion. CO2 binds to ammonium in liver (energy-demanding) creating urea.
•	Uric acid: Birds, insects, many reptiles, land snails. Relatively non-toxic, can be excreted as a semisolid paste (little water required). Costs a lot of energy.



Kidneys
Perfrom the following functions
•	Terminate waste products
•	Regulate pH and osmotic pressure of blood
•	Can change blood pressure
•	Urine is collected in the renal pelvis and leaves through ureter
•	Functional section of kidney: Nephron


Glomerulus 
•	High blood pressure in glomerulus
•	Blood pressure is regulated with help of hormone renine
•	Ultrafiltration in glomerulus: Water soluble substances are pressed out of blood vessels in glomerulus (high blood pressure) and mix with water inside bowman´s capsule = preliminary urine (in humans ca. 150l/meal).



Urine production
Preliminary urine is travelling through all these tubules and the loop of Henle. Ca. 99% of it is being reabsorbed into the interstitial fluid (both active and passive transport/water through osmosis), the rest ends as urine in the collecting duct, which leads to the renal pelvis.





RAA-System
RAA stands for Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone. it perfroms the following functions 
•	Regulates urine production and blood pressure
•	Glomerulus releases renin when blood pressure is low
•	Renin activates angiotensinogen in liver, which transforms it to angiotensin 1
•	Lung cells convert angiotensin 1 into 2 with help of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
•	Angiotensin 2 
1.	Constricts blood vessels (vasoconstriction)
2.	Triggers production of ADH (antidiuretic hormone): Makes kidneys release less water (and give back to blood), thus produce less urine
3.	Triggers production of aldosterone (adrenalin gland): Makes kidneys reabsorp salt, which also keeps water in kidneys
•	Blood volume increases through water -> blood pressure rises even more
